    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I'm an Asian senior high graduate, and also a comming college student.</p>
    <p>My first step in IT field began when I first knew about deepin Linux - an elegant GNU/Linux distribution from PRC. It was not long before I installed it with the help of tutorials and successfully made it coexist with Microsoft Windows.</p>
    <p>Since then I've been crazy about computer science. So far I've found a large amount of programming languages, such as C/C++, Java, HTML/CSS/JS, Ruby, PHP, Python, Perl, Julia, Crystal, Rust, Go, Erlang, Elixir, Common Lisp, Scheme, Tcl, Nim, Vala, Typescript, Coffeescript, Haskel, Objective-C, C#, F#, VB.NET, Swift, etc.In the future I'll release some articles to discuss them.</p>
    <p>Programming languages are just tools. What matters most is how to make the most of them to structure powerful softwares or toolkits. Viewing many programming languages, I am amazed at their various features. I believe with my numerous efforts I will have a total insight of the whole software system - including graphics, audios, hardware drivers and operating systems.</p>
    
    <h1>Why I Use English</h1>
    <p>Of course my mother tongue is not English. But there are some reasons why I use it.</p>
    <p>Firstly, English is actually the most universal language in the world, used so as to make the blogs more understandable.</p>
    <p>ASCII is actually the most compatible character set. Every operating system supports it, unless the OS can't receive user's keyboard input. If I don't use ASCII, there may appear something wrong with text display.</p>
    <p>If you've used operating systems except Microsoft Windows before, you will know that configuring a non-English input method is painful. Most of the input methods are proprietary, unstable and difficult to use. Thus, I would rather use English.</p>

    <h1>My Philosophy</h1>
    <p>I stands with <b>free software</b>, as is introduced by <b>Free Software Foundation</b>.</p>
    <p>Differing from open source softwares, not only do free softwares have their source codes easily accessed, but they also indeed respect user's freedom. People should have the right to run, study, fix and share the software they use.</p>
    <p>My suggestions: We should use neither open source to quote free software, nor commercial software and close source to refer to proprietary software. There are neutral alternative words for free software: <b>Libre</b> and <b>FOSS</b>(of course free software is extremely recommended), and for proprietary ones: non-free.</p>
    <p>It's a shame that many apps widely used - such as Microsoft Windows - are proprietary. But I'm happy when I see some free software projects are launched to provide a compatible POSIX layout or complete kernel alternative - Cygwin, WineHQ, ReactOS, etc. I firmly hold the belief that with the advancement of productivity, free software will decide the destination of software industry's progress.</p>
