# Hello World!

I'm new here.

Here are notes about git and markdown.

In the future I'll release a markdown parser and  tutorials about other version control toolkits.

# About My Philosophy

- I am an Asian senior high now(when it's 2022-4-11).

- I stand with free software, as is claimed and recommended by Free Software Foundation and GNU project.

- In my opinion, free software is the subset of open source, because some open source software restrict user's freedom.

- Free Software Foundation urges users of proprietary softwares to move to the corresponding alternative free software. But I dare say in the short run it is almost impossible to let everyone do that.

- After all, a lot of proprietary software is widely used, including the majority of social apps, hardware drivers(Like notorious Nvida driver), operating systems.

- Out of this, most people, including me, temporarily cannot be accustomed to lives completely without them.

- It is okay for me to use GNU/Linux distrobutions instead of Microsoft Windows. But without some proprietary driver the system cannot work normally.

- Some free software need heavy professional knowledge and crazy configurations.

- For example, on GNU/Linux you need to learn to manage packages.Though there are GUI package managers and most of operations are automated, they may sometimes work awfully and it's not as convenient as that in Windows - double click, tap "Next Step" and you have a software installed.

- Also many system settings are written in config files, which make people harder to alter them. It is far more troublesome than that in Windows - open "Control Panel" or Win10 settings and then you can get an overview of system configurations.

- Most people know nothing about console and consider using commandline as an awkward user experience. Even many of them know nothing about free software.

- I hope free softwares can be more user-friendly, enabling users indeed to use them fluently without any basics of computer science.

- Also I'll be dedicated to free software project to make the world better!
