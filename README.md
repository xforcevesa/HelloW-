# Hello World!

- I'm new here.

- Here are notes about git, markdown, and some other useful things for programmers.

- This is my first repository in Github! Hence, I name it "Hello World". Thanks for your stars!

# Why I Use English

- Of course my mother tongue is not English. But there are some reasons why I use it.

1. English is actually the most universal language.

2. ASCII is actually the most universal character set. Every operating system supports it, unless it can't receive user's keyboard input. If I don't use ASCII, there may appear something wrong with text display.

3. If you've used operating systems except Microsoft Windows before, you will know that configuring a non-English input method is painful. Most of the input methods are proprietary, unstable and difficult to use. Thus, I would rather use English.

# About Me

- I'm an Asian senior high student.

- My first step in IT field began when I first knew about deepin Linux - an elegant GNU/Linux distribution from PRC. It was not long before I installed it with the help of tutorials and successfully made it coexist with Microsoft Windows.

- Since then I've been crazy about computer science. So far I've found a large amount of programming languages, such as C/C++, Java, HTML/CSS/JS, Ruby, PHP, Python, Perl, Julia, Crystal, Rust, Go, Erlang, Elixir, Common Lisp, Scheme, Tcl, Nim, Vala, Typescript, Coffeescript, Haskel, Objective-C, C#, F#, VB.NET, Swift, etc.In the future I'll release some articles to discuss them.

- Programming languages are just tools. What matters most is how to make the most of them to structure powerful softwares or toolkits. Viewing many programming languages, I am amazed at their various features. I believe with my numerous efforts I will have a total insight of the whole software system - including graphics, audios, hardware drivers and operating systems.

## My Philosophy

- I stand with **free software**, as is introducted by *Free Software Foundation*.

- Differing from *open source* softwares, not only do free softwares have their source codes easily accessed, but they also indeed **respect user's freedom**. **People should have the right to run, study, fix and share the software they use.**

- My suggestions: We should use neither ~~open source~~ to quote free software, nor ~~commercial software~~ and ~~close source~~ to refer to proprietary software. There are alternative words for free software: **Libre**, **FOSS** and **FLOSS**, and for proprietary ones: **non-free**.

- It's a shame that many apps widely used - such as Microsoft Windows - are proprietary. But I'm happy when I see some free software projects are launched to provide a compatible POSIX layout or complete kernel alternative - Cygwin, WineHQ, ReactOS, etc. I firmly hold the belief that with the advancement of productivity, free software will decide the destination of software industry's progress.
