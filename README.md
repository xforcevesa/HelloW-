# Hello World!

I'm new here.

Here are notes about git and markdown.

In the future I'll release a markdown parser and  tutorials about other version control toolkits.

# About My Philosophy

- I am an Asian senior high now(when it's 2022-4-11).

- I stand with free software, as is claimed and recommended by Free Software Foundation and GNU project.

- In my opinion, free software is the subset of open source, because some open source software restrict user's freedom.

- Free Software Foundation urges users of proprietary softwares to move to the corresponding alternative free software. But I dare say in the short run it is almost impossible to let everyone do that.

- After all, a lot of proprietary software is widely used, including the majority of social apps, hardware drivers(Like notorious Nvida driver), operating systems.

- Out of this, most people, including me, temporarily cannot be accustomed to lives completely without them.

- It is okay for me to use GNU/Linux distrobutions instead of Microsoft Windows.

- But without some proprietary driver the system cannot work normally.

- Some free software need heavy professional knowledge and crazy configurations, and even some of them often works badly, which may completely disappoint users.

- Most people know nothing about console and cannot bear do anything by input commandlines. Even many of them know nothing about free software.

- I hope free softwares can be more user-friendly, enabling users indeed to use them fluently without any basics of computer science.

- Also I'll be dedicated to free software project to make the world better!
