<h1>Overview Of Version Control</h1>

<h2>What Is This Version Control</h2>
<p>Version control is a system that records changes to files over time.</p>

<h2>Why Do We Need It</h2>
<p>It enables us to recall specific versions later.</p>

<p>e.g. a graphic or web designer need to preserve all versions of images and layouts. They can get started to use a Version Control System.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that they can copy these files so as to perform a "version control", it is easy to forget which directory you’re in and accidentally write to the wrong file or copy over files you don’t mean to. Also it doesn't work well with collaborative development.</p>

<p>Version Control System is just aimed at solving the version problem.</p>

<h2>Local Version Control System</h2>
<p>It keeps patch sets (i.e. the differences between files) in a special format on disk.</p>

<p>It can re-create what any file looked like at any point in time by adding up all the patches.</p>

<p>It only works in every single computer system, and has the risk of data loss.</p>

<h2>Centralized Version Control System</h2>
<p>It is designed to meet the needs of collaborative development.</p>

<p>It has a central version control server to manage a database that perserve all versions.</p>

<p>Every developer works as the client checking out files from the server and submitting their revisions.</p>

<p>If server crashes into errors or encounters other exceptions, nobody can collaborate or save changes at all, and even all versions might be lost.</p>

<h2>Distributed Version Control System</h2>
<p>There are still servers, but clients can mirror all history versions rather than a single snapshot.</p>

<p>Every single client can have one's own repository and work as the server, such as so-called distributed system.</p>

<p>Many a client works pretty well with repository mirrored, and is thus able to collaborate with different groups in different ways simultaniously within a single project.</p>

<p>Clients can also create several workflows, such as hierarchical model.</p>

<p>git is as such.</p>
